2. However to run the app on your mobile phone, you need to do the following:

  In this file remove "10.0.2.2" which is the domain and add the IP address of the wifi being used

2:Go to app then java then android.example.schooleasy then network and open the RetrofitClientInstance class.
  In this class change the part "10.0.2.2" of the BASE_URL to the IP address of the wifi being used
